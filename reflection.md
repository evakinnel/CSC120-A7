Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

The constructors (in all 3 classes), so that it would be possible to use any of the classes without knowing the address or number of floors
The sellCoffee() function in Cafe, so that it could take in size as "small" "meduim" and "large" instead of the exact ounces
The moveOut() function in House, so someone could be removed from the house without their name being known, only their place in the arraylist

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was cool to think of ways to change what was already there and make it easier/more convenient for certain uses.
I could not figure out another way to overload any of the methods in Library. My advice for this one would be to listen and ask questions in class becuase it's very simple, but I originally missed the implementation a bit and felt like I couldn't do it.
